# PHP - Job Listing Project

This project was developed using vanilla PHP, emphasizing the fundamentals of vanilla PHP in building a CRUD application in a framework-like manner without using any frameworks or libraries. The project is an exploration into architecting a web application following best practices in software development, structured to mimic the design patterns seen in popular PHP frameworks, such as Laravel, but all from scratch. <br>

## Features

- **Custom Laravel-like Router**: Implementation of a router that supports HTTP methods, parameters, and middleware, teaching the intricacies of web request handling.
- **Framework and App Structure**: The project is structured into two main folders, which will be called Framework and App. Framework will be the core that includes classes like Router, Database, Validation, and Session. App will include our controllers and views. This structure separates core functionalities from business logic, mirroring the organization of professional-grade PHP applications.
- **CRUD Operations**: Creation of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for job listings, grounding the understanding of database interactions in PHP.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Building a secure system for user management and route protection, essential for any real-world application.
- **Search Feature**: Development of a feature to search and filter job listings, enhancing the application's usability.
- **Data Validation and Sanitization**: Ensuring data integrity and security through proper validation and using PDO for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
